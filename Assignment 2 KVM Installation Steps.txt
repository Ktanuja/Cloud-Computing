Check Virtualization Support on Ubuntu 20.04
1. Before you begin with installing KVM, check if your CPU supports hardware virtualization via egrep command:

egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

2. Now, check if your system can use KVM acceleration by typing:

sudo kvm-ok

3. To install cpu-checker, run the following command:

sudo apt install cpu-checker

Step 1: Install KVM Packages
1. First, update the repositories:

sudo apt update

2. Then, install essential KVM packages with the following command:

sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils

Step 2: Authorize Users
1. Only members of the libvirt and kvm user groups can run virtual machines. Add a user to the libvirt group by typing:

sudo adduser ‘username’ libvirt

2. Now do the same for the kvm group:

sudo adduser ‘[username]’ kvm

Step 3: Verify the Installation
1. Confirm the installation was successful by using the virsh command:

virsh list --all

2. Or use the systemctl command to check the status of libvirtd:

sudo systemctl status libvirtd

3. Press Q to quit the status screen.

4. If the virtualization daemon is not active, activate it with the following command:

sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
